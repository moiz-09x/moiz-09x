I'm a **Product Manager with strong hands-on engineering experience**, focused on building **0→1 products** that actually ship, scale, and create business impact. While my day-to-day role sits at the intersection of product, business, and users, I enjoy getting close to the code, architecture, and data — not just writing specs.

## 🚀 What I Build

I work on products where **ambiguity is high and constraints are real** — early-stage platforms, internal tools, and production systems used by real customers.

On GitHub, you’ll find projects that demonstrate:

* Building products **from scratch (0→1)**
* Translating business problems into **scalable technical solutions**
* Designing APIs, databases, and system workflows
* Prototyping, shipping, and iterating fast

My background spans **SaaS, IoT, retail, e-commerce, and enterprise platforms**, often across international markets.

## 🧠 How I Think About Products

I approach product building as a **full-stack problem**:

1. Understand the user and business constraint
2. Design the system (flows, data models, APIs)
3. Build or prototype the solution
4. Measure usage, reliability, and outcomes
5. Iterate based on real signals

I love spending time in **technical documentation, third-party API docs, and integration guides**, and translating them into clean, reliable implementations.

This mindset allows me to collaborate deeply with engineers while still owning product outcomes.
